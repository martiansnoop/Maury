# Pathfinder Item Generator

This is the beginnings of a Pathfinder magic item generator. It's intended primarily for a Kingmaker campaign, though could be repurposed. 

## Notable things left undone:

1. Data tables need to be parsed. I've written the beginnings of a parser, but I'm unsure which magic item generation format I want to use (CRB vs the new rules in Ultimate Equipment. I've also heard the game master's guide has another system).
2. UI needs finalizing. Currently it's a mishmash of half-understood Bootstrap, the primary purpose of which is to not burn my eyes too badly. 
3. No build/minification process. 

## Installation (on Mac/Linux. You're on your own for Windows)
1. Install Node and npm, if not already installed. Google for directions.
2. Install Bower: `npm install -g bower` You may need to use `sudo npm install -g bower` or equivalent
3. Clone this project
4. Run `bower install` inside cloned project
5. Open index.html in a browser
